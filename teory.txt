Here I will put a summary of what I'm learning:

With unit tests, we can verify that everything works as expected during a flow. For example, if we request a string, everything goes well, and if not, what would happen.

What is a test?

As developers, we need to ensure that the code we write meets certain requirements/expectations. We do this through a test.

This ensures that:

css

Our code meets the standard.
We send to production without errors.

Types of tests

We must keep in mind that there are two types of tests:

css

Functional.
    Unit Tests - Small parts of our code are tested, ensuring that they meet the desired requirements. (In a web page, tests translate to testing each section of the page and all interactions within them).

Non-functional.

Jest

Jest is a JavaScript framework for testing.

Test folder or test, the latter being the most commonly used standard.
To define files, we always use the naming convention of name.test.js to identify the type.

Syntax:

test("descripcion", () => {
    expect...algo
})
